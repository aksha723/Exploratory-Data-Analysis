Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset
Project Overview
This project demonstrates Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover valuable insights and patterns. The goal is to gain a betterunderstanding of the dataset through various data visualization techniques and statistical analysis.

Tools Used
Python programming language

Libraries:

Pandas for data manipulation

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

NumPy for numerical operations

Dataset Overview
The dataset contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including whether they survived or not, along with their characteristics like age, gender, class, and other personal details. This dataset helps in understanding the factors that influenced passenger survival rates.

Key Features in the Dataset:
PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.
Survived: Whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).
Pclass: Passenger class (1, 2, 3).
Name: Name of the passenger.
Sex: Gender of the passenger.
Age: Age of the passenger.
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard.
Ticket: Ticket number.


Fare: Ticket fare.

Cabin: Cabin where the passenger stayed.
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton).

Objective of the EDA
The goal of this EDA is to:
Understand the distribution of key variables like age, fare, and survival status.
Identify missing or inconsistent data.
Visualize relationships between different variables and their effect on survival rates.
Draw conclusions from the analysis that can inform future predictive modeling.

Key Insights
Survival Rate: The dataset shows that a significant portion of passengers did not survive. By analyzing the survival rate 
across different categories (e.g., gender, class, age), we can identify patterns and make observations about which factors contributed to survival.

Gender: Female passengers had a higher survival rate compared to male passengers.
Passenger Class: First-class passengers had a higher chance of survival than second and third-class passengers.
Age: Younger passengers (especially children) had a higher survival rate compared to older passengers.

Steps in the EDA Process
Data Cleaning: Handle missing data (e.g., filling missing values for age, cabin, etc.) and ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.
Descriptive Statistics: Use Pandas .describe(), .info(), and .value_counts() to get an overview of the data.
Data Visualization: Use Seaborn and Matplotlib to plot graphs like:
Countplot to visualize survival distribution.
Boxplot to understand the distribution of numerical features like age and fare.
Heatmap to show correlations between variables.
Observations and Conclusion: Draw conclusions based on the visualizations and statistical analysis.

How to Use
Clone or download the repository.

Run the Jupyter notebook (EDA_Titanic.ipynb).

Review the analysis and visualizations.

Modify or add additional steps as required for deeper analysis or further insights.

Conclusion
This EDA gives us a clear understanding of the Titanic dataset. The findings are helpful for building predictive models
and making data-driven decisions. With this analysis, we can move forward to create classification models to predict passenger survival.
